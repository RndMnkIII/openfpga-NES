Port by agg23. Core by Ludvig Strigeus and many others.

Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), referred to as the Famicom in Japan was the first major home console produced by Nintendo. An 8-bit console that really made gaming stand out to a lot of people.

Please report all issues to agg23, as most likely any issues experienced are issues with the port, not the core.
